Two source code files have been modified: HSTNAM and MMAILR,
in order to prioritize Chaosnet connections over Internet/TCP.
Since HSTNAM is a library which is used in other parts of the 
MM mailsystem, everything is recompiled by the (modified) 
BUILD-MM.CTL.

To install things, copy almost every resulting .EXE file to 
SYS: (I suggest <CHAOS.SUBSYS> to keep the Chaos separate).

In the original Panda system, the following are set Ephemeral:
MSTAT.EXE
QDMAIL.EXE
SEND.EXE
SNDSTA.EXE
WHAT.EXE

In the original Panda system, the following are in SYSTEM: 
rather than SYS:
MAISER.EXE
MAPSER.EXE
