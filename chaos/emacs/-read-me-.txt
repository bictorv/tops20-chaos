This directory is used to make an EMACS which works with VTS (MIT
Virtual Terminals, used in the SUPDUP protocol).

CONFIG.MID contains a terminal type code for VTS==26. which should
match .TTSUP in the monitor.

A working compile relies on a fresh NMIDAS compiled with a fresh
TNXDFU generated from a fresh MONSYM.UNV, containing the VTS
definitions.

See EMACS.CTL for compilation instructions.
