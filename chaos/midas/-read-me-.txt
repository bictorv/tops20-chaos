To generate a new MIDAS.EXE based on the new MONSYM.UNV (with Chaos symbols)
do what MIDAS.MID says, i.e:

First make the monitor, and install the resulting MONSYM.UNV in SYS:.

Compile CVTUNV.MID with the existing MIDAS, and run CVTUNV.EXE to 
generate TNXDFU.MID.

Compile MIDAS.MID with the existing MIDAS,
get midas
start it at PURIFY (which you can find the address of by EXAMINE PURIFY).
save it in SYS:

To compile TECO, you need a larger symbol table. 
Consider compiling as follows:
midas nmidas_midas/t
SYMDSZ=11657.*2
^Z

and then purify NMIDAS and install it, and use for TECO.
Or just compile the regular MIDAS that way.
